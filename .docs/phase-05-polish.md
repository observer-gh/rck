## Phase 5 – Polish & Optional Enhancements

Candidates:

1. Re-match selected subset (partial re-clustering) tool.
2. Admin analytics: distribution of ranks per club, average interest overlap, classification confidence.
3. Club renaming or manual override field.
4. Export/import including new fields (employee_number, personality answers) with version header.
5. Cleanup legacy `preferred_atmosphere` after migration stability.
6. Toggle to simulate alternative thresholds sets (demo scenario switcher).
7. Accessibility & i18n pass (English labels).

Out-of-Scope (defer unless requested):

- Real ML/NLP or vision integration.
- Database migration (JSON→SQLite) until scale demands.

Exit Criteria:

- Stakeholder demo-ready with clear, explainable pseudo-AI features.
